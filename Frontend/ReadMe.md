Windows Problem

You could encounter a problem when deploying react app on windows: << Plugin "react" was confliected between "package.json" >>eslint-config-react-aoo>> >>

Workaround for that is savin the package.json with ctrl+s one time

To permanently fix the problem open the Algoverse folder with Code instead of a folder superior of it pathing is kind scuffed up in recent next.js implementations
